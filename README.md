### Overview
This project contains a comprehensive SQL revision notebook that demonstrates key SQL skills with questions and answer. It is designed to cover everything from fundamental concepts to more advanced topics.

### Key Features:
- **Basic SQL Queries**: SELECT, WHERE, GROUP BY, HAVING, ORDER BY.
- **Joins**: Inner joins, outer joins, and self-joins.
- **Subqueries**: Nested queries for complex data extraction.
- **Window Functions**: LAG, LEAD, RANK, DENSE_RANK, NTILE for analysis.
- **Advanced SQL Concepts**: PARTITION BY, CTEs, and recursive queries.


### Technologies
- **Google Colab**: The notebook was developed using Google Colab for easy access and execution.
- **SQLite**: Database engine used for querying data.

### Why This Project Stands Out
This notebook provides hands-on demonstrations of important SQL techniques frequently used in data analysis and database management roles. It's ideal for both revision and showcasing skills to potential employers.
